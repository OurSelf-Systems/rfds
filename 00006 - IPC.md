# IPC (Inter-Process Communication)

There needs to be a mechanism by which running Self worlds communicate with each other and with the control world. The minimum core mechanism would allow the control world to notify running jail Self instances of, for example, an impending shutdown to give them a chance to snapshot themselves.
Beyond that, it should be possible for running Self worlds to request compute resources or access to resources from the control world (e.g., "Please give me Internet access"). It should also be possible for each Self world to communicate with other Self worlds to share tasks and communication.
Or to combine the two, it should be possible for a Self world to request that a new world is awakened and then communicate with that world. An example use case would be a compute-heavy task: we could have a Self world whose job is to receive requests to compress a data stream. It does so by cloning a worker world, waking that worker world up, requesting the worker world compress the data and return it, and then shutting the world down.
The idea is that by default, Self virtual machines are running in a single OS-level process or thread, but we want to have all the possible processes and threads for a machine being used. The natural fit is a messaging model. We don't want Self worlds spawning user-level threads within their jail as we're mixing up levels; we want to handle it all at the messaging level. So we want a standard mechanism for worlds to message each other, and then we can build resource access, compute access, and data access on top of that.

## Desired Qualities for IPC

We would like the IPC to have these qualities:

- Fast: We're talking primarily about local IPC. Currently, Psyche is not being built as an explicit cluster system; it's designed to run on one machine. As such, it should be very fast to communicate between Self worlds.
- Secure: There are no trust barriers within a Self world, but between Self worlds, there should be barriers. It should not be a cooperative system that relies on goodwill. We need to be mindful of the possibility of a rogue Self world. For example, we might have a third-party Self world that we've downloaded onto our machine that provides a useful task. We don't want to have to rely on it being bug-free; we want to be able to message without it being able to interfere with other systems.
- Identity Management: We want a system of IPC that manages identity. We don't want to layer a third-party identity management system on top; we don't want to encrypt and digitally sign messages between worlds on the same system. We want a Self world receiving a message to be confident that the message was received from the world it claims to be from. We want to ensure that when we send out messages, they only get received by the intended entities.

## Existing Options for IPC

Several options exist for implementing IPC:

- **Use an off-the-shelf message broker such as NATS** (found at nats.io). NATS is a message broker that can run with simple clients either over Unix domain sockets or over TCP/IP. It has built-in security and messaging. We could have either direct messages or message queue-style pub/sub messages. The upside to NATS is that we could likely mold it into what we want quite easily. The downside is it's not a pure Self solution; it's another external piece of code added to the technical stack for the project. It claims to be fast, though it's unclear exactly what that means in our context.
NATS would run in the root environment and then would expose itself through domain sockets to all the sub-worlds. As it stands, the Self virtual machine can't access domain sockets, but that's not too difficult to add, or in the short term, we could simply use socat to expose the domain socket over TCP on the local system of each world.
Existing RPC solutions such as D-Bus. These seem overly complex, and it's unknown if they're fast enough, but they do seem focused on small messages. Ideally, our system will be able to handle both small and large messages (e.g., video encoding should be able to run over it).
- **Write our own system**: The simplest approach would be a NATS-style system or message broker. We could use domain sockets, POSIX queues, or similar as the access method. Then we have a process running in the root that periodically handles any data put through those channels. Because it maintains and knows what the channels are and knows where the data is coming from, it can securely deal with the communications.
Once again, it is unknown if this would be fast enough for our needs. If we're going to use this as the primary mechanism for inter-jail/inter-world communication, we need it to be as fast as possible. Otherwise, it becomes used only for some situations (control messages and so on), and then a second or third system springs up to handle faster communications.
An alternative might be shared memory. We could mount 64 kilobytes of shared memory in each jail, have semaphores attached to that, and a broker sitting at the root level. When the semaphore is triggered, it copies from one slice of memory to another. This would reduce the overhead of a message transfer to copying the memory once and triggering a couple of semaphores.
It would be interesting to consider whether there's some broker-less model that could be used, but I haven't found a model that satisfies both the requirements for speed and security. A broker-less model would be fine in a cooperative system, but one of our aims is to have something stable and secure where worlds can only read messages intended for them.
The time it takes to set up is relevant. Ideally, we would implement this in Self, perhaps as a second Self image so we're running at the right level, slaved to control. Its job would be to open, close, and copy between shared memory segments.
It might be easier just to use NATS and plug it in. It's fairly small, self-contained, under active use and development, and under a liberal license.

## IPC Content

So far, we've only discussed the mechanism for communicating between jails, not the content of the messages. This assumes, in effect, that we're talking about transferring byte vectors around, and that the metadata attached to those is straightforward (who sent it, who it's addressed to, how long it is).
To make the system useful, some standards will need to be put in place above that level. No hard and fast rule has been made yet on how messages will be represented or serialized to send over the messaging system.
