# RFD Process

This is a repo for Requests for Discussion. It is not the finalised documentation for the system but dicussions and explanations of goals, changes etc.

It in effect operates as a meta-level of documentation for the project.

The aim is to cargo cult the practices of better organised projects, and hope some of it rubs off. The modern equivalent of carrying round a textbook and hoping you learn what is in it by osmosis...
