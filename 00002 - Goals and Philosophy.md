It's important to remember that Self (and by extension, Psyche) is intended to be a multi-user system. A Self world or process is designed for multiple people to connect simultaneously and collaborate. While an individual can use it alone, the system is not philosophically a "bicycle for the mind" or a system designed for a solitary genius. It's a place for individuals and small teams to collaborate.
